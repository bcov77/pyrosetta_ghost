# pyrosetta_ghost

Here's my version of the rosetta shim to bring stuff back. Probably not a good idea to use this.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bcov77/pyrosetta_ghost.git  
pip install pyrosetta_ghost  
```

```python
import pyrosetta_ghost
```

This will put everything back where it used to be, but again, probably not a good idea.
